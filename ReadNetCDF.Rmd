```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load the Libraries and Read the Data 
You'll need the following libraries: 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(ncdf4)
library(chron) 
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(lattice) 
```

Make sure that the working directory is set to where your NetCDF file is saved. 
Read the data using the nc_open function. We'll be working with the ACCESS1-0 RCP4.5 data in this example. 
```{r}
ncin <- nc_open("tasmax_ACCESS1-0rcp45.nc")
```

## Extract Data from the NetCDF File 
Now tha the NetCDF file is loaded in R, we can extract the information we need.

Extract longitude and latitude data. 
```{r}
lon <- ncvar_get(ncin,"lon") 
```
